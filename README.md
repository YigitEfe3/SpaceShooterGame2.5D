# SpaceShooterGame2.5D
I've created this 2.5D game using Unity and C#

The aim is to stay alive while enemy spaceships approaching you.

Features:
- The player can control the space ship using WASD keys and shoot with the space bar.
- If the ship goes out of bounds from the right side of the map, it will come back from the left, and vice versa.
- There is an upper bound and a lower bound that can not be passed.
- If the enemy ships are not destroyed when they are at the bottom of the screen, they will resapwn at the top, making it more crowded every time an enemy is not killed.
- The player has 3 lives.
- One life will be lost if the ship makes contact with an enemy ship.
- There are 3 different buffs;
        * Speed: Your spaceship is now faster! (For a limited time).
        * Triple Shot: Your spaceship can now shoot 3 lasers at once (For a limited time).
        * Shield: Your spaceship is now immune to the next damage (For a limited time).
- Buffs will be spawned periodically and will not respawn at the top if not collected.

Here are some screenshots:
